Output

    Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
    The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)

Example of error with sh:$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
